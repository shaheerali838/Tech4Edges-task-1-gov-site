                            <p>
                                <strong>Ladies and Gentlemen, I cordially thank you, with the utmost sincerity, for the
                                    honour
                                    you have conferred upon me — the greatest honour that it is possible for this
                                    Sovereign
                                    Assembly to confer — by electing me as your first President. I also thank those
                                    leaders
                                    who have spoken in appreciation of my services and their personal references to
                                    me.</strong> I
                                sincerely hope that with your support and your co-operation we shall make this
                                Constituent Assembly an example to the world. The Constituent Assembly has got two main
                                functions to perform. The first is the very onerous and responsible task of framing our
                                future constitution of Pakistan and the second of functioning as a full and complete
                                Sovereign body as the Federal Legislature of Pakistan. We have to do the best we can in
                                adopting a provisional constitution for the Federal Legislature of Pakistan. You know
                                really that not only we ourselves are wondering but, I think, the whole world is
                                wondering at this unprecedented cyclonic revolution which has brought about the plan of
                                creating and establishing two independent Sovereign Dominions in this sub-continent. As
                                it is, it has been unprecedented; there is no parallel in the history of the world. This
                                mighty sub-continent with all kinds of inhabitants has been brought under a plan which
                                is titanic, unknown, unparalleled. And what is very important with regards to it is that
                                we have achieved it peacefully and by means of a revolution of the greatest possible
                                character.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Dealing with our first function in this Assembly, I cannot make any well-considered
                                pronouncement at this moment, but I shall say a few things as they occur to me. The
                                first and the foremost thing that I would like to emphasise is this — remember that you
                                are now a Sovereign legislative body and you have got all the powers. It, therefore,
                                places on you the gravest responsibility as to how you should take your decisions. The
                                first observation that I would like to make is this. You will no doubt agree with me
                                that <strong>the first duty of a Government is to maintain law and order, so that the
                                    life,
                                    property and religious beliefs of its subjects are fully protected by the
                                    State.</strong>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The second thing that occurs to me is this. <strong>One of the biggest curses from which
                                    India
                                    is suffering... is bribery and corruption.</strong> (Hear, hear.) That really is a
                                poison. We
                                must put that down with an <strong>iron hand</strong> and I hope that you will take
                                adequate measures
                                as soon as it is possible for this Assembly to do so.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Black-marketing is another curse.</strong> Well, I know that black-marketers are
                                frequently
                                caught and punished. According to our judicial notions sentences are passed, and
                                sometimes fines only are imposed. Now you have to tackle this monster which today is a
                                colossal crime against society, in our distressed conditions, when we constantly face
                                shortage of food and or the essential commodities of life. A citizen who does
                                black-marketing commits, I think, a greater crime than the biggest and most grievous of
                                crimes. These black-marketers are really knowing, intelligent and ordinarily responsible
                                people, and when they indulge in black-marketing, I think they ought to be <strong>very
                                    severely punished</strong>, because they undermine the entire system of control and
                                regulation
                                of food-stuffs and essential commodities, and cause wholesale starvation and want and
                                even death.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The next thing that strikes me is this. Here again is a legacy which has been passed on
                                to us. Along with many other things good and bad, has arrived this great evil
                                -<strong>the
                                    evil of nepotism and jobbery</strong>. This evil must be crushed
                                <strong>relentlessly</strong>. I want to
                                make it quite clear that I shall never tolerate any kind of jobbery, nepotism or any
                                influence directly or indirectly brought to bear upon me. Wherever I find that such a
                                practice is in vogue, or is continuing anywhere, low or high, I shall certainly not
                                countenance it.

                                I know there are people who do not quite agree with the division of Indian and the
                                partition of the Punjab and Bengal. Much has been said against it, but now that it has
                                been accepted, <strong>it is the duty of every one of us to loyally abide by it and
                                    honourably
                                    act according to the agreement which is now final and binding on all.</strong> But
                                you must
                                remember, as I have said, that this mighty revolution that has taken place is
                                unprecedented. One can quite understand the feeling that exists between the two
                                communities wherever one community is in majority and the other is in minority. But the
                                question is whether it was possible or practicable to act otherwise than has been done.
                                <strong>A division had to take place.</strong> On both sides, in Hindustan and Pakistan,
                                there are
                                sections of people who may not agree with it, who may not like it, but in my judgment
                                there was no other solution and I am sure future history will record its verdict in
                                favour of it. And what is more it will be proved by actual experience as we go on that
                                that was the only solution of India’s constitutional problem. Any idea of a United India
                                could never have worked and in my judgment it would have led us to terrific disaster.
                                May be that view is correct; may be it is not; that remains to be seen. All the same, in
                                this division it was impossible to avoid the questions of minorities being in one
                                Dominion or the other. Now that was unavoidable. There is no other solution. Now what
                                shall we do? <strong>Now, if we want to make this great State of Pakistan happy and
                                    prosperous
                                    we should wholly and solely concentrate on the well-being of the people, and
                                    especially
                                    of the masses and the poor.</strong> If you will work in co-operation, forgetting
                                the past,
                                burying the hatchet, you are bound to succeed. If you change your past and work together
                                in a spirit that <strong>every one of you, no matter to what community he belongs, no
                                    matter
                                    what relations he had with you in the past, no matter what is his colour, caste or
                                    creed, is first, second and last a citizen of this State with equal rights,
                                    privileges
                                    and obligations there will be no end to the progress you will make.</strong>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>I cannot emphasise it too much. We should begin to work in that spirit and in
                                    course
                                    of time all these angularities of the majority and minority communities... will
                                    vanish.</strong> Indeed if you ask me this has been the biggest hindrance in the way
                                of India
                                to attain its freedom and independence and but for this we would have been free peoples
                                long long ago. No power can hold another nation, and specially a nation of <strong>400
                                    millions souls</strong> in subjection; no body could have conquered you, and even if
                                it had
                                happened, no body could have continued its hold on you for any length of time but for
                                this. (Applause.) Therefore we must learn a lesson from this. <strong>You are free; you
                                    are
                                    free to go to your temples, you are free to go to your mosques or to any other
                                    places of
                                    worship in this State of Pakistan. You may belong to any religion or caste or creed
                                    —
                                    that has nothing to do with the business of the State</strong> (Hear, hear). As you
                                know,
                                history shows that in England conditions some time ago were much worse than those
                                prevailing in India to-day. The Roman Catholics and the Protestants persecuted each
                                other. Even now there are some States in existence where there are discriminations made
                                and bars imposed against a particular class. Thank God we are not starting in those
                                days. We are starting in the days when there is <strong>no discrimination, no
                                    distinction
                                    between one community and another, no discrimination between one caste or creed and
                                    another. We are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens
                                    and
                                    equal citizens of one State.</strong> (Loud applause.) The people of England in
                                course of time
                                had to face the realities of the situation and had to discharge the responsibilities and
                                burdens placed upon them by the government of their country and they went through that
                                fire step by step. Today you might say with justice that Roman Catholics and Protestants
                                do not exist: what exists now is that every man is a citizen, an equal citizen, of Great
                                Britain and they are all members of the nation.
